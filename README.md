This is a JavaFX project that loads a turn-based battle game where a player and an enemy character take turns attacking each other until one of them wins or loses. 
The player can choose from three weapons to battle with: a sword, an axe, or a lance.
Both player and enemy characters have a random chance to do 3x the normal damage (this is a critical hit).
